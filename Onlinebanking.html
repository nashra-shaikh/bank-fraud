            <h2>What Is Online Banking?</h2>
            <p>Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions through the internet. Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments.</p>
            <p>Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking you can access through a computer or app. Online banking is also known as internet banking or web banking.</p>

            <h2>Pros and Cons of Online Banking</h2>
            <div class="pros">
                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Convenient</li>
                    <li>Fast and efficient</li>
                    <li>Easy to monitor accounts</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <h3>Pros explained:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Convenience:</strong> Basic banking transactions can be done at any time of day or night, seven days a week. If your bank offers a payment network such as Zelle, you can use your online bank account to send money to a person or business. You can also open and close various accounts online, such as checking and savings accounts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fast and efficient:</strong> Funds can be transferred between accounts almost instantly, especially if the two accounts are held at the same institution. Plus, mobile check deposits can be made in just a few minutes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ease of monitoring accounts:</strong> You can closely monitor your accounts to spot suspicious activity. Around-the-clock access to banking information provides early fraud detection, serving as a guardrail against financial losses.</p>

            <div class="cons">
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer service challenges</li>
                    <li>Tech and connectivity required</li>
                    <li>Hacking risk</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <h3>Cons explained:</h3>
                    <p><strong>Customer service challenges:</strong> Sometimes, you might need to visit a branch to handle certain transactions, such as buying a cashier’s check. In other cases, you might not even have access to a branch. Furthermore, you may prefer depositing checks, withdrawing money or discussing your financial needs face-to-face.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tech and connectivity required:</strong> Some customers may need to be more comfortable with the tech-heavy aspects of online banking. For example, they may need help with some online tasks, such as setting up automatic payments. In addition, online banking depends on a reliable internet connection. Connectivity issues make it difficult to process transactions when you want to.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hacking risk:</strong> Although security continually improves, online accounts remain vulnerable. Customers should use their wireless plans rather than public Wi-Fi networks when logging into an online bank account. This can help prevent unauthorized account access.</p>

            <h2>How Can You Safely Use Online Banking?</h2>
            <p>To shield your money and your personal information from cyber crooks, you should take these safety precautions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Set a strong, unique password, and change it regularly.</span> The federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency recommends a password with at least 16 characters. The password should contain a random string of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                <li>Rely on a password manager to help discreetly set and remember passwords.</li>
                <li>Enable two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication if it’s available. This involves using at least two forms of identification, such as a password and a fingerprint, to access an online account.</li>
                <li>Never provide your online banking details to other people.</li>
                <li>Avoid online banking when using public Wi-Fi, such as at a coffee shop or restaurant.</li>
                <li>Check your accounts regularly for suspicious activity and report suspected fraud immediately.</li>
            </ul>
